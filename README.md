# [![https://t.co/qikOEJXLXu](logo.png)](https://t.co/qikOEJXLXu) Hello, my name is Gastón.

### I like backend, I think.

I am student of Computer Engineering in UNTreF (Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero).

Backend programmer with a little knowledge in Java, Go and Python *(unfortunately)*... at the moment.

User of Arch Linux btw (yes, that kind of people).

For now, I like other things like coffee ☕, cats 🐈 and ATLA.
