# ![https://t.co/qikOEJXLXu](logo.png) Hello, my name is Gast√≥n.

### I love backend, I think.

I am student of Computer Engineering in UNTreF (Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero).

Backend programmer with knowledge in Java, Go and Python *(unfortunately)*... at the moment.

User of Arch Linux btw (yes, that kind of people).

For now, I like other things like coffee ‚òï and cats üêà, that's why I'm a litte curious about how technology works in every way possible... maybe.

Click on the turtle!
